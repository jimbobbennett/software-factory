"""Human gate: Jim reviews the PR on GitHub. Deterministic, no agent.

The factory acts on GitHub as Jim, and GitHub won't let you approve or request
changes on your own PR. So Jim's verdict is a comment (or COMMENT review) that
starts with a command:

    /ship                    merge it
    /changes <what to fix>   send it back to the babysitter (inline review comments
                             posted since the gate opened are included too)

Merging or closing the PR by hand also counts.
