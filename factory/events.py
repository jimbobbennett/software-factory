"""Factory event bus: append-only JSONL that the dashboard tails.

Every station calls emit() when it starts, finishes, fails or waits. The
dashboard (dashboard/server.py) streams this file to the browser over SSE.
Events are deliberately tiny and flat so they can also be joined to Arize
traces later via trace_id.

Schema:
    ts        ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
    run       run id, e.g. "issue-12"
    issue     GitHub issue number
    title     issue title (sent on the first event of a run; optional after)
    station   issue | spec | build | ci | babysit | review_correctness |
              review_security | review_tests | router | automerge | human |
              release | done
    status    start | ok | fail | wait | info
    detail    short human-readable text
    trace_id  optional Arize trace id for deep links
    pr        optional PR number
